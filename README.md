# UNity-Invaders

Simple tutorial project to go through the whole process of developping, source code management and publishing to Google Play.

This project uses the singleton pattern a lot. Not my favorite architecture pattern.

TODO:
- Add the new Unity Input System
- Add control mapping feature
- Offer multiple art styles for aliens and ship
- Investigate how to add multi-player (local multiplayer and real multiplayer with invite friends request instead of automatic game matching)

Thanks to from [comp3-interactive](https://www.comp3interactive.dev/#/) for a nice complete [game tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfhbBaEcybmhGhADxKSqqliuCLg3xY_ep) serie.
